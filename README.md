# React workshop: Reducers and custom hooks

This application demonstrates the use cases and common patterns for reducers and custom hooks for state and effect management in React.

## Installation

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Usage

This app is most effective as a learning tool. By switching to the various commit checkpoints, you will see common problems caused by data fetching and local state management. The final commit also illustrates some basic best practices around component design.

To navigate between commits:

1. `git log`: View the list of commits
2. `git checkout <commit_hash> | <tag>`: Navigate to the specific commit you want to view, using its hash, or the tag of the commit.
